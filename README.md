NoAnalytics
===========

Clone of GoogleAnalytics for Android that does nothing - use as replacement in open source apps to make them free.

Usage
-----

### To build CyanogenMod
Once android_external_google is removed from CyanogenMod, it is no longer possible to build the Settings app. Luckily you can add NoAnalytics to your build system to fix this:

	<project path="external/NoAnalytics" name="mar-v-in/NoAnalytics" revision="master" />


### General Purpose
Replace "libGoogleAnalytics.jar" (or whatever it's named) with the binary "noAnalytics-0.*.jar" (or a self-compiled version) and recompile the Application.
